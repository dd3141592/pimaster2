<Template name="sidebar">

<!-- Create a backing surface for the menubar. Can be used for displaying background images under
     the menu, and other things. If you look at the style sheet you will see we use it to create
     a rectangle with rounded corners and border to act as a container for our menu items. Notice
     it uses a z-index of -2 which places it under the menu items that use a z-index of -1. Also
     notice that all components specify an X size of 'undefined'. The width of the sidebar is
     defined later when we actually render it.That way we can change the size of the whole sidebar
     dynamically if needed.
-->
{{#Surface id = "mb" size="[undefined,undefined]" class="sidebarback" translate="[0,0,-2]"}} {{/Surface}}

<!-- Create our 5 menu items. Note that only the first 3 will render new templates when tapped. Look
     close at the 'class' parameter for each item. We are playing a little trick here. We need to be
     able to know which template to render when a button is pressed. We can query the classlist of 
     the button that creates the tap event so we can take advantage of that to 'pass' information back
     to our code and not have to write a bunch of jQuery. Just a little trick!
      
     The surface id's are named m1-5 to make it easier to iterate through them using code.
     The content for each surface is an image located in the public folder.
