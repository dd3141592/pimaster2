<!-- The need for a backing surface will become apparent when we do the chat code.
     All we are doing with the backing surface is setting the background color.
     The z-index is -1 which makes it display behind our content which is set to 0.

    class 'task' is being used. To lazy to rename it in CSS I guess! Just being real here.
