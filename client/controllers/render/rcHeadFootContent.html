<!-- Create our render controller (this is a famous-views shortcut)
     Use a helper function to get the transition type

<!-- the following is a way to do dynamic template loads. Courtesy of the creator
     of famous-views for using this. Basically it works like this: use a helper function
     to get the value of currentTemplate and assign it to a data key called 'name'. We can
     pass arrays into the template which is what we are doing here. Use a helper function
     (showTemplate) that calls the Meteor Template function to get a template object
     based on it's name. Then it gets rendered! The current release of Meteor has this build in
     now with the {{>Template.dynamic template=currentTemplate}} construct.
